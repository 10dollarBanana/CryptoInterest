# CryptoInterest

When looking for a place to compare crypto interest rates I found most sites were either out of date, inaccurate, or didn't compare sites I was interested in.

To keep things as apples-to-apples as possible, the APY rates here are all for the lowest level, tier 1, etc. rates. These are all non-staking/flexible term rates. Hope some find this data helpful.
